# Abstract
This paper presents the design, development and implementation of a reconfigurable low-cost biopotential amplifier trainer module (RTR module) and quantitative analysis of the studentsâ€™ compatibility with the trainer module. The trainer module can measure Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG) biopotential signals by reconfiguring the module using the basic circuit and filtering blocks. Given hand on experience, the module is designed and implemented in such reconfigurable manner that the students can avoid, disconnect and add any filtering blocks to understand the effect of these filters to the biopotential signals. The laboratory experience is an important component of the learning process. The RTR module is a low cost and compact educational tool. With this RTR module, the students should be able to recognize the biopotential signals and the acquisition methods in an intuitive and easy way, allowing them to improve their skills of designing biomedical instrumentation.
